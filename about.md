## Hi

I am called Dan. This is where I share things I write. I don't write as often as I'd like. Some of the things on here are getting a little dated and perhaps don't reflect my current interests or maybe even my current opinions. But I'll leave them around either way. The cool thing about a personal website is that you can do whatever you want. There isn't enough of that. Of just doing what you want, playing, being creative, not worrying about results. We need more of that I think.
