title: An acre to sow
---
This is my little [corner of the
internet](https://vanschneider.com/blog/portfolio-tips/a-love-letter-to-personal-websites/),
my acre to sow. It's not much to look at right now. But I can make it what I
want and change it over time. It's fine. I can make it super not-fancy because
that's also fine. I could also make it super fancy because I know how to but I
think most of the fancy stuff on the internet is not really worth it so, you
know, just because you can doesn't mean you should and all that.
