title: "Write Useless Code"
---
Writing code is ultimately a creative endeavor, you start with the absence of
code and finish with the existence of code. Your brain tells your fingers what
to type, and then stuff happens. You can type anything you
want. Just like you could paint anything you want were you painting rather than
typing. You could paint a sweet picture of a sword. That would be sick. It
really doesn't matter. Of course, however, there are different
outcomes depending on the combination of things you type. So if you have some
specific set of ideal outcomes those are going to act as constraints.
Constraints enhance creativity. Think of how little creativity a prison escape
would require if prisons were parks and prisoners were told to sit on the grass
for a little while. As far as prisons go that would be a bad design and The
Shawsank Redemption would have been a much shorter and less interesting movie.

Luckily I work for a company that doesn't blindly push conformity, but
sometimes it's easy to forget that we need to think laterally when we write
code. We're called Software Engineers and engineering conjures notions of rules
and formality and boundries and deteminism. Blueprints to be followed. That
might be closer to the truth for engineers who create physical things, but we
engineer abstractions, our blueprints are less formal. Create something that
keeps prisoners in generally the same spot for as long as we need them to be
there. That's about as formal as it gets a lot of times.

The scope of our requirements definitely vary. The prison example is pretty
broad, like project-level broad. Most of the time the scale of our requirements
are at the method level, or at least that's the unit we work with most often. I
need to take an array of user objects and return a list of first names sorted
alphabetically -- that kind of thing. It's pretty specific. It's also not a hard
problem to solve. Your room to get creative is limited unless you want to write
a bunch of code nobody understands. Other people understanding our code is a
universal constraint placed upon us as software engineers. Like other creatives,
our work must encapsulate our message, our intent. But unlike other creatives we
can't obscure our intent for the sake of being coy or to jog interpretation. However, when we're
designing how these simple atomic implementations come together to fulfill our broad requirements
there isn't always a clear path forward. We must get creative.

Most of us probably got into this profession because we like building things,
solving problems, and doing it in a way that doesn't make us feel like machines.
And that's the point, that's what we need to remember -- as creative problem solvers we flourish. We learn from each other.
We are happier. We develop novel solutions. We are not calculators. This is why
we should always take time to write useless code.

Useless code is code without an agenda. It may be related to the problem at hand
or it might just be exploratory, what-if-we-tried-this type of code. Useless
code is sketching. It's working through your curiousity without being attached
to utility. It's taking things apart and putting them back together differently,
or just flat out breaking things.

Sometimes there is definitely a smell and you aren't sure exactly where it's
coming from, but you know you don't like it. You can sense that things could be
organized better or you're sure there's an abstraction hiding somewhere. Maybe
there's even an entirely new service buried in a tangle of some other things.
When they're not obvious how do you find those seams without exploring, trying,
poking, prodding? You're going to have to write some code that might just get thrown
away to find your bearings and get rid of the smell. Or maybe the smell is one you have
to live with, but at least you looked and now know it to be true.

We get presented with the same flavor of problems a lot so we end up reusing
patterns, algorithms, and techniques. We also have to deal with technicalities a
lot, things like
why-won't-this-thing-talk-to-that-thing-and-that-other-thing-is-maybe-configured-wrong-and-all-I-want-to-do-is-write-code kinds of things. Other times we have to move
fast so we shove some code into a class it doesn't belong or copy and paste from
somewhere just to get things out the door. These situations come with the
territory but over time they make our creative muscles tight. Useless code is
stretching. Stretching creates space. Space gives you room to grow.

This all might sound like fluffy woo woo. Worse, it might sound like wasting
time. That's the wrong perspective. This approach is an investment. The freedom to be expressive,
curious, and creative drives engagement and it's profitable. It's the only way
to solve hard and new problems. Those problems are differentiators and solving
them creates value. Value is nothing more than a packaged solution to a problem
other people need solving. That's the ultimate irony of useless code, it's of
utmost use.

Times are weird right now but they might also present opportunities to solve
interesting problems in interesting ways with interesting code. So remember to
let yourself stretch, and just as importantly, encourage the engineers you work with to stretch.
Remember the difference between standards and personal preference, between
telling and teaching. Remember it's possible to communicate clearly with
different sounding voices. Remember that creativity is distinct from technical
know-how. Remember that this is so much freaking fun. Remember that you can type
anything you want.
